# ELM Hillslope test
This test is devoted to the simplified hillslope exmaple that can be generilized for the ELM model parametrization

1. Create hillslope_2D.exo by follwoing steps in the [hillslope_mesh.ipynb](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-testsuite-arctic/blob/master/testing/ELM-hillslope/mesh/hillslope_mesh.ipynb) ipython notebook file
2. To partition the mesh use [mesh_partition.sh](https://github.com/amanzi/ats-testsuite-arctic/blob/master/testing/ELM-hillslope/mesh/mesh_partition.sh) script. Before running the scipt create folder '4'.
